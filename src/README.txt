To run Part_3, open CMD or equivalent and navigate to the same folder as Part_3.py. Then, you need to activate the
virtual environment (venv). To do this, you can execute the following command: venv\Scripts\activate.bat. Once this is
completed, you can run the Part_3.py script using the following command: python Part_3.py. This should run the script,
which can take a while but eventually the covariance matrix should be output to the console, followed a while later
by the test results and then a graph will be opened in a new window, which will show the risk vs return for the
training set. Then, if you close this graph, another will appear, showing the risk vs return on the test set.
